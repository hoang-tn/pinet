"""Hard constraint neural network package.

The jaxtyping import hook wraps every function and class defined under
``pinet.*`` (except the Torch backend imported via ``pinet.torch``) with
``beartype.beartype`` so the shape/dtype annotations in ``pinet._typing``
are enforced at trace time — a mismatched argument surfaces at the call
site instead of deep inside a jitted function.

The hook is **on by default**. Set ``PINET_RUNTIME_CHECK=0`` before
importing ``pinet`` to disable it (useful for latency-sensitive
production runs); beartype checks are O(1) on the hot path, so the
overhead lives on the first call / trace path and disappears once jit
compiles the wrapped function.
